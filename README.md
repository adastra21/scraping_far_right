# Scraping Far Right

This was part of my summer research project at Duke University which aimed to study the intersection between Latinxs and the Far Right in the United States. Using the scrapers in this repo, I scraped about 275K articles from four popular far-right websites. I am making the scrapers available to help research into the Far Right.
